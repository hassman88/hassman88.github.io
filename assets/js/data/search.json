After many weeks of hard work it is good to see the birds all grown up and starting to pick their forever families as was the case with this first one. The buyer met me at my house and I introduced him to the females as this was his preference. During talks with him one of the bird flew to him and started nibbling at his watch, it was then the choice was made and the young pineapple female was then placed into her transport box for the trip to her new home.Next ClutchesMissy and FluffyWow have these 2 been busy. They are currently raising 4 babies with last baby only hatching a few days ago and the oldest being nearly 2 weeks old now. I will pulling the oldest hatchling in the next few days and starting the hand raising process all over again after only a couple of weeks break.Emerald and SilverThese 2 have laid 6 eggs with the first due to hatch in the next day or so. all eggs are looking good to hatch and I am looking forward to meeting all the new hatchings.Buddy and HollyThis pair is a very new pair and a bit of a experiment for me as I have never made my own pairs before. So far things are looking very good with 5 eggs in the nest with the first to hatch within the week. Holly is a Pineapple Conure and Buddy is a Turquoise normal with some possible splits.I have no idea what the colours of the babies will be however I look forward to the surpise when the hatchings start to feather." }, { "title": "Growing Up and More Eggs", "url": "/posts/Growing-Up/", "categories": "breeding, missyandfluffy, handraising", "tags": "breeding, missyandfluffy", "date": "2022-11-01 01:30:00 +1030", "snippet": "Babies Growing Up Fast With More To Come9 Babies 2 NestsOut of the 2 nests that I am hand raising I have a total of 9 babies 5 pineapples, 4 turquoise normal and 1 turquiose cinnamon. 3 of the babies have fully fledged and weaned with the remaining 6 not far behind.As the birds grow I am taking them out of the brooder during the day and piutting them in a large cage for the day time hours to help give them more human interations and more areas to explore. I am offer all the babies fruit and veg as well as pellets just like their parents.More Eggs!!!!Missy was only off the nest less than 2 weeks then went down for the next clutch. She is currently sitting on 7 eggs with the first to hatch within the next week. Emerald is also sitting on 3 eggs at the time of writing after having a bit longer of a break compared to Missy.New BirdsThis has been my first time buying in single birds to make my own breeding pairs and I very impressed with the results so far. I bought a male Turquoise normal (possible splity to pineapple) a few months ago. I have recently found him a pineapple and oh boy did they hit it off. Just over 2 weeks together and she has laid her first egg today with the hopes of more to come." }, { "title": "Hatching Progress", "url": "/posts/Hatchling-Progress/", "categories": "breeding, missyandfluffy, handraising", "tags": "breeding, missyandfluffy", "date": "2022-10-01 00:30:00 +0930", "snippet": "Hatching ProgressMissy and FluffyOut of the 6 eggs that missy laid all were fertile however the last egg did not hatch. Not sure as to why I did candle the egg a few days after it was due to hatch, it looked to be still growing. Later that day I checked on the nest to find the egg gone. All the other hatchling from this nest have been doing well and are all now being hand rasised with youngest at 7 days old.Emerald and SilverEmerald edded up with 7 eggs for her first nest however only 5 of them were fertile so I removed 2 infertile eggs from the nest after I was very sure they were infertile. To my surprise all 5 eggs hatched within 5 days from first to last, even having 2 eggs found to be hatched on the same day. Again just like Missy, Emerald is a great parent and is doing very well raising all 5 babies at this stage. The oldest hatchling in this nest is currently 6 days old.Hand RaisingThis time I have started to hand raise with 4 birds from Missy’s nest nearly a week ago now. All birds are doing well with both being away from parents and with hand feeding. I hand feed the bird with “Passwell Hand Rearing Mix” following the guide that is on the packaging however I have found that conures like this food a bit warmer than what is recomended. When the food is too cold the birds will not eat it, same is said for food being too hot.With the increase in amount of pairs of birds I have breeding now I upgraded my brooder to be larger and be in 2 bays so I can have 2 different tempertures if needed like I will need soon." }, { "title": "Silver is Fine and Happy", "url": "/posts/Silver-Fine/", "categories": "breeding, missyandfluffy", "tags": "breeding, missyandfluffy", "date": "2022-09-08 00:30:00 +0930", "snippet": "Clutch UpdateFirst of all Silver is fine after having a bleeding foot and is back to his normal self.Missy and FluffyMissy has stopped at 6 eggs as shown in the last post and I can confirm that all the eggs are fertile and will be looking forward to them hatching. I am having now issues going in and checking on the nest after moving them into a bigger aviary after last season. I was thinking that Fluffy would be more agressive to me in this aviary however it has been the oposite.Emerald and SilverEmerald has caught up to the others with 6 eggs currently with most of them being fertile if not all of them. She is doing a good job as a first time parent and I am looking forward to seeing how they go with all the babies." }, { "title": "Clutches Growing", "url": "/posts/Clutches-Growing/", "categories": "breeding, missyandfluffy, emeraldandsilver", "tags": "breeding, missyandfluffy, emeraldandsilver", "date": "2022-09-03 00:30:00 +0930", "snippet": "Clutches GrowingMissy and FluffyThis clutch has grown to 6 eggs with most of them confirmed to be fertile eggs. Missy now spends most if not all of her time in the nest incubating the eggs. Fluffy is in and out of the nest but never to far away from the nestbox.Silver and EmeraldNot long after my first post the first egg was laid by Emerald. She waited untill she had 4 eggs in the nest before incubating the eggs. She now has 5 eggs as of time of writing this and some of them I have confirmed to be fertile. Silver has been in and out the nest and like Fluffy never to far from the nest. Silver has injury to his right foot, not sure what has happened however it looks like he has lost a toe nail from what I have been able to see. I have been keeping my eyes on him to see if he gets worse so far all is good." }, { "title": "Early start after late finish", "url": "/posts/New-Season/", "categories": "breeding, missyandfluffy", "tags": "breeding, missyandfluffy", "date": "2022-08-23 00:30:00 +0930", "snippet": "Starting the 22/23 SeasonMissy and FluffyMissy and Fluffy have made a early start on the new breeding season going down for their third time after gifting me 2 clutches of last season with the second finishing in late March. Today we have 2 eggs in the nest with more on the way if they follow previous trends of at least 8 eggs each clutch.Emerald and SilverSilver and Emerald are looking very happy together and I guess I just have to wait a bit longer for their first clutch." } ]
