# Starting the 22/23 Season

## Missy and Fluffy

Missy and Fluffy have made a early start on the new breeding season going down for their third time after gifting me 2 clutches of last season with the second finishing in late March. Today we have 2 eggs in the nest with more on the way if they follow previous trends of at least 8 eggs each clutch.

## Emerald and Silver

Silver and Emerald are looking very happy together and I guess I just have to wait a bit longer for their first clutch.
