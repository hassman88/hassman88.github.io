# Saying Goodbye

Today I said goodbye to the first lot of this seasons babies. After many weeks of hard work it is good to see the birds all grown up and starting to pick their forever families as was the case with this first one. The buyer met me at my house and I introduced him to the females as this was his preference. During talks with him one of the bird flew to him and started nibbling at his watch, it was then the choice was made and the young pineapple female was then placed into her transport box for the trip to her new home.

# Next Clutches

## Missy and Fluffy

Wow have these 2 been busy. They are currently raising 4 babies with last baby only hatching a few days ago and the oldest being nearly 2 weeks old now. I will pulling the oldest hatchling in the next few days and starting the hand raising process all over again after only a couple of weeks break.

## Emerald and Silver

These 2 have laid 6 eggs with the first due to hatch in the next day or so. all eggs are looking good to hatch and I am looking forward to meeting all the new hatchings.

## Buddy and Holly

This pair is a very new pair and a bit of a experiment for me as I have never made my own pairs before. So far things are looking very good with 5 eggs in the nest with the first to hatch within the week. Holly is a Pineapple Conure and Buddy is a Turquoise normal with some possible splits.

I have no idea what the colours of the babies will be however I look forward to the surpise when the hatchings start to feather.
