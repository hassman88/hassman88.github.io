# Babies Growing Up Fast With More To Come 

## 9 Babies 2 Nests

Out of the 2 nests that I am hand raising I have a total of 9 babies 5 pineapples, 4 turquoise normal and 1 turquiose cinnamon. 3 of the babies have fully fledged and weaned with the remaining 6 not far behind.

As the birds grow I am taking them out of the brooder during the day and piutting them in a large cage for the day time hours to help give them more human interations and more areas to explore. I am offer all the babies fruit and veg as well as pellets just like their parents.

## More Eggs!!!!

Missy was only off the nest less than 2 weeks then went down for the next clutch. She is currently sitting on 7 eggs with the first to hatch within the next week. Emerald is also sitting on 3 eggs at the time of writing after having a bit longer of a break compared to Missy.

## New Birds

This has been my first time buying in single birds to make my own breeding pairs and I very impressed with the results so far. I bought a male Turquoise normal (possible splity to pineapple) a few months ago. I have recently found him a pineapple and oh boy did they hit it off. Just over 2 weeks together and she has laid her first egg today with the hopes of more to come.
