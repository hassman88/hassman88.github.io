# Clutch Update

First of all Silver is fine after having a bleeding foot and is back to his normal self.

## Missy and Fluffy

Missy has stopped at 6 eggs as shown in the last post and I can confirm that all the eggs are fertile and will be looking forward to them hatching. I am having now issues going in and checking on the nest after moving them into a bigger aviary after last season. I was thinking that Fluffy would be more agressive to me in this aviary however it has been the oposite.

## Emerald and Silver

Emerald has caught up to the others with 6 eggs currently with most of them being fertile if not all of them. She is doing a good job as a first time parent and I am looking forward to seeing how they go with all the babies.
