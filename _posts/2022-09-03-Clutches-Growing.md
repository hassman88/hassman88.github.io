# Clutches Growing

## Missy and Fluffy

This clutch has grown to 6 eggs with most of them confirmed to be fertile eggs. Missy now spends most if not all of her time in the nest incubating the eggs. Fluffy is in and out of the nest but never to far away from the nestbox.

## Silver and Emerald

Not long after my first post the first egg was laid by Emerald. She waited untill she had 4 eggs in the nest before incubating the eggs. She now has 5 eggs as of time of writing this and some of them I have confirmed to be fertile. Silver has been in and out the nest and like Fluffy never to far from the nest. Silver has injury to his right foot, not sure what has happened however it looks like he has lost a toe nail from what I have been able to see. I have been keeping my eyes on him to see if he gets worse so far all is good.
