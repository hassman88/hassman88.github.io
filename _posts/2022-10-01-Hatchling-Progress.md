# Hatching Progress

## Missy and Fluffy

Out of the 6 eggs that missy laid all were fertile however the last egg did not hatch. Not sure as to why I did candle the egg a few days after it was due to hatch, it looked to be still growing. Later that day I checked on the nest to find the egg gone. All the other hatchling from this nest have been doing well and are all now being hand rasised with youngest at 7 days old.

## Emerald and Silver

Emerald edded up with 7 eggs for her first nest however only 5 of them were fertile so I removed 2 infertile eggs from the nest after I was very sure they were infertile. To my surprise all 5 eggs hatched within 5 days from first to last, even having 2 eggs found to be hatched on the same day. Again just like Missy, Emerald is a great parent and is doing very well raising all 5 babies at this stage. The oldest hatchling in this nest is currently 6 days old.

## Hand Raising

This time I have started to hand raise with 4 birds from Missy's nest nearly a week ago now. All birds are doing well with both being away from parents and with hand feeding. I hand feed the bird with "Passwell Hand Rearing Mix" following the guide that is on the packaging however I have found that conures like this food a bit warmer than what is recomended. When the food is too cold the birds will not eat it, same is said for food being too hot.

With the increase in amount of pairs of birds I have breeding now I upgraded my brooder to be larger and be in 2 bays so I can have 2 different tempertures if needed like I will need soon.
