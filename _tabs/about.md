## History

I have for many years had a love for birds in particular Green Cheek Conures and Quakers (blue mostly). Recently I have goten back into breeding them after buying my first breeding pair back in October of 2021. I chose a pair of pineapple conures to restart my breeding journey. Only after a few months of being in there new home and being named by the family (Missy and Fluffy) we had eggs being laid.

Given the success of this pair I worked on finding a double avariy to house 2 pairs of birds and getting my next pair in Januray of 2022. I have hand raised all my baby birds from about 7 to 10 days old using Passwell Hand Rearing mix and the fantastic help of my wife and children.

## My Birds

### Missy and Fluffy

Missy and Fluffy are the Pineapples and my first pair after many years away from breeding. They are both fantastic parents given that the first clutch was 9 eggs they did a great job getting them ready for us to hand raise them.
